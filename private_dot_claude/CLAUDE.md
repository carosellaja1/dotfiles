## Workflow Principles

- **Always research best practices before beginning work with any tech of any kind.** Don't trial-and-error with commands. Read the docs, understand the patterns, and plan the approach first.

## Project Preferences

- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for new projects
- Use pnpm as the package manager when possible
- Follow conventional commits for git messages
- Write tests for critical functionality

## Code Style

- Use 2-space indentation for JS/TS, 4-space for Python
- Prefer functional patterns where appropriate
- Document public APIs with JSDoc/docstrings
